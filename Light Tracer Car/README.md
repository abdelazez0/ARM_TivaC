# Light Tracer Car

## Project Description

The car is equipped by:
1. Two Photo-Resistors.
2. Ultrasonic Sensor Module HC-SR04.
3. One DHT22 Temperature sensor.
4. On-board Temperature sensor.
5. One LCD that displays the temperature.
6. Four motors + one motor drivers.

- The car motors are started and stopped by the on-board 2 switches (optional).
- When motors are started, the car moves and swings to the way with the highest illumination.
